# Survey-on-Privacy-Preserving-Models-for-Targeted-Advertising
Abstract

 User activity on the internet is of crucial importance for the economic benefit of prevalent business models. Users are not just the actors that generate data that runs these models, but also the target audience for receiving tailored advertisements by interacting with the Web. In playing such a dual role, the responsibility of their data privacy shifts to engineers designing these targeted advertising models, and to regulatory bodies to ensure consumer data is protected. Privacy-preserving models for such tracking mechanisms essentially decide the inclusiveness and anonymisation of parts of the data that can help preserve privacy. This survey researches some of these models to gain context on what aspects of targeted advertising are being remodelled to achieve privacy-preservation, and to what extent do they give control to the user. The papers surveyed would help understand specific user profiling in various classified models, what privacy attacks can they circumvent, and how much control do users have in the process. It also aims to include important social aspects like bias of any form that a particular mode of targeting has the potential to show, and conflict in providing consent by studying user experience on these ads.
